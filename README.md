## Created a Face Detection Attendance program in python with the help of OpenCV, Numpy, Face recognition library.


- Face Recognition Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library. Built using dlib's state-of-the-art     face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

- To detect the faces it needs a datasets of saved faces so that it can compare the live feed and find the best suited match in the datasets.

- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. And is written in C++ and its primary interface     is in C++, but it still retains a less comprehensive though extensive older C interface.


- NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level             mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
